### Introduction
# Overview
I am an aspiring software engineer, exploring the various technologies that lead the industry. My goal is to build my understanding of these softwares so that I can keep up to date with the contsantly changing industry.

This vehicle management Application will allow a user to enter some basic information about their vehicle and then keep a record of the vehicles, fuel consumption and mileage. This provides a foundation to track the efficiency of your vehicle and cost and functionality.

I wrote this piece of software because I have wanted to have an application I could use to track my vehicle usage to make more accurate budget, predictions, and better maintain my own vehicles.

# Web Pages

Since I had created a react web application, I built one webpage. The dynamic part of this page is the displaying of each vehicle in the garage. It will change, depending on what the user enters for their vehicles.

# Development Environment

I used next.js to create the app using the create-next-app command. I wrote the typescript in Visual Studio Code.

I used typescript and react framework to build the application.

# Future Work

* I need error handling for each of the forms found on the page.
* Better styling for the page to make it easier to understand.
* Connecting the data to a database to store the data for if the page is closed.
* Create a dashboard view of vehicle information.

### Running the App
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
